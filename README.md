#  I.T.O.S.

**Into The Outer Space** is an app focused on displaying daily astronomy pictures from NASA API (APOD).
It's been developed as a way to practice Kotlin and explore the newly release Jetpack.

I've tried to use any Jetpack packages that would fit such as:
- Livedata
- Navigation
- Room
- Paging

### Setup
- Create apikey.properties in the project root folder and add NASA_KEY="YOUR_KEY";
- Add your google-services.json to ~/app
